# UserRegistry
It is very basic application to perform CRUD operations. 
This project has been developed by using Spring Data Api for CRUD operations, and Mongo Db is used as a Database.In order to run this app,Mongo Db version is needed to installed and connection must be opened by 'mongod' command "You can do this using cmd in bin directory of mongo ,: /bin mongod " before running application.Otherwise,none of a CRUD operation will work.
Also,Mongo Db needs data\db a directory in like C:\data\db to keep records.
It has single jsf page,also references primefaces framework fore better look and feel.Every single part of functionality is done by ajax standarts and rules on the page.
